# GIT vs. GitHub  





## What is [Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git)?  

  Git is an extremely popular version control system that is at the heart of a wide variety of high-profile projects. Git is installed and maintained on your local system (rather than in the cloud) and gives you a self-contained record of your ongoing programming versions.

## Git has three main states that your files can reside in: modified, staged, and committed:

* Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.

* Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.

* Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.
